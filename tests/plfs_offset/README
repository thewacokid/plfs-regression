This test is used to verify that the the plfs API correctly:
 opens, writes with offsets, reads with offsets and closes a file.

Files:
- reg_test.py Handles top level management of the test including calling
              offset.bash       
- offset.c  C source code that gets compiled with plfs libs.  It performs 
            file operations as described above
- offset.bash Script that compiles offset.c and and executes offset binary
              that performs various plfs file operations.
- check_results.py Determines if the test has passed or failed
