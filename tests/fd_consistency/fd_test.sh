# look for file descriptor leaks. 

# Initialize variables

# Number of times to build plfs (loop count)

# Function to end an iteration for a mount point. This function will perform
# tasks that need to be done to make sure everything is cleared away for the
# next iteration. This function can be called when an error is encountered or
# when all tests have performed successfully for an iteration.
#
# Usage:
# iteration_end TARGET COUNT COUNTMAX MOUNT
#
# Input:
# - TARGET: the target directory that the plfs tarball is in. The function 
#   will cd into this directory so that the tarball and directory can be
#   removed.
# - COUNT: which iteration is ending
# - COUNTMAX: how many iterations are going to be run for a given mount point
# - MOUNT: the mount point being worked on
