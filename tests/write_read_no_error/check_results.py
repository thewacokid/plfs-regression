    This function should be the only portion that needs to be edited
    for a specific test. It will receive a list of logfiles that
    should be in the order that the experiments were submitted in.
    In other words, output_files is the output associated with
    the first job submitted through experiment_management,
    output_files[1] is the second, and so on.

    This function should return a list. The number of required fields depends:
    - if the test passed, it should pass a list where the first element
      is a string containing the single word PASSED.
    - if the test failed, it should pass a list where the first element
      is a string containing the single word FAILED. The second field should
      be a string containing a path to the logfile where the error condition
      occured. It is permissable to have the second field be an empty string
      by using '' if there is no specific log file to return.
    More output can be sent via using fields in the list after the required
    fields. For example, to send a description of what went wrong, return
    something like the following:

    return ['FAILED', '/path/to/some/log/file', 
        'Expected read error not seen']
    return ['PASSED', 'Took longer than usual, but ok']
    return ['FAILED', '', 'Job never started', 
        'something really bad happended']

    More than one field can be passed. Expect that each extra field will be
    printed on it's own line. Extra fields can be passed for PASSED of FAILED.
